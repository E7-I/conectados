üåê **Conectados** is a web application where users that offer services (like hairdressing, electricity, gardening, etc.) can connect with those who need them quickly, securely, and reliably.

Each professional can create their profile, upload photos of their work, indicate prices, categories, and available hours. Users can search by type of service, location, or availability, chat directly with the person, schedule services, and leave a review afterward.

## üß™ Running Cypress Tests

To run the end-to-end tests with Cypress:

1. Go to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd conectados
    ```
2. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the Cypress test runner:
    ```bash
    npx cypress open
    ```
   This will open the Cypress UI where you can select and run tests.

   Or, to run tests in headless mode:
    ```bash
    npx cypress run
    ```
## Production Branch and GitHub Actions

The [live](https://github.com/E7-I/conectados/tree/live) branch was created to host the code currently in production. Within this branch, in the [.github/workflows](https://github.com/E7-I/conectados/tree/live/.github/workflows) directory, you can find our GitHub Actions, which are responsible for executing the entire workflow for deployment on Azure.

These actions are divided into two files:

- [Frontend](https://github.com/E7-I/conectados/blob/live/.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-delightful-flower-08c627f1e.yml): With a static web app
- [Backend](https://github.com/E7-I/conectados/blob/live/.github/workflows/live_conectadose7.yml): With a web app + Azure Cosmos for MongoDB, in this pipeline we also added [Selenium tests](https://github.com/E7-I/conectados/tree/live/selenium) and a notification if this tests pass/fail on our discord server

And the site is available [here](https://delightful-flower-08c627f1e.6.azurestaticapps.net/)
